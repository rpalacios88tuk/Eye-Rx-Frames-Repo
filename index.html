    <h4>Lens Redo Policy</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Eye Rx Frames will redo lenses for customers within 60 days of the original purchase date, provided that the customer meets the criteria outlined below.</li>

      <li>The customer must schedule an appointment with an optician or eyecare professional at Eye Rx Frames to determine the reason for the dissatisfaction and to discuss the desired changes.</li>
      <li>If the dissatisfaction is due to a prescription change, the customer must provide a new prescription from their eye doctor before the redo can be performed.</li>
      <li>If the dissatisfaction is due to the lens material or coating, the customer must pay the difference in cost between the original and desired lenses.</li>
      <li>If the dissatisfaction is due to a mistake or error made by Eye Rx Frames, the redo will be performed at no additional charge to the customer.</li>
      <li>Eye Rx Frames reserves the right to deny a redo if the customer has damaged or altered the original lenses or frames in any way.</li>
      <li>Eye Rx Frames is not responsible for any loss or damage to the original lenses or frames during the redo process.</li>
